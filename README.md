- **Include visual elements thoughtfully** — Use images, logos, and badges that enhance rather than distract
- **Optimize for mobile** — Ensure content reads well on small screens
- **Add contact information** — Make it easy to reach maintainers (Discord, Slack, email, discussions)

## FAQ

### What is a GitHub organization profile README?

A GitHub organization profile README is a special Markdown file displayed on your organization's public profile page (e.g., `github.com/your-org`). It appears in the "Overview" tab and serves as your organization's homepage on GitHub, visible to all visitors before they explore your repositories.

### Where is the organization profile README file located?

Create a **public** repository named `.github` in your organization. Inside this repository, create a folder called `profile` and add a `README.md` file: `.github/profile/README.md`

For example, if your organization is `awesome-org`, the file path would be:
```
github.com/awesome-org/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md
```

### Does GitHub officially support organization profile READMEs?

Yes! Organization profile READMEs are an official GitHub feature launched in 2021. They're fully supported and documented in the [official GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile).

### Can I create a members-only README?

Yes. Create a **private** repository named `.github-private` and add `profile/README.md` inside it. This README will only be visible to organization members when they switch to the "Member" view.

### Do organization profile READMEs improve SEO or discoverability?

Yes, in multiple ways:
- **GitHub search** — Content is indexed and searchable within GitHub
- **Search engines** — Public READMEs are crawled by Google, Bing, etc.
- **AI systems** — Language models and AI search tools can read and cite your profile
- **Social sharing** — GitHub generates preview cards when your org is shared on social media

Well-optimized READMEs with clear keywords and structured content significantly improve visibility.

### Can companies and private organizations use this?

Absolutely! Organization profile READMEs work for:
- Open source foundations and communities
- Technology companies (public or private)
- Educational institutions
- Startups and small teams
- Enterprise organizations
- Non-profits and advocacy groups

The feature is available on all GitHub plans, including Free, Team, and Enterprise.

### What format should I use?

Organization profile READMEs support **GitHub Flavored Markdown** (GFM), including:
- Headers, lists, links, and text formatting
- Images and GIFs
- Emojis (`:emoji_name:`)
- Code blocks and syntax highlighting
- Tables
- Task lists
- Footnotes
- Alerts and callouts

HTML is also supported but use it sparingly for maintainability.

### How long should my organization README be?

There's no strict limit, but best practices suggest:
- **Minimum:** 150-300 words covering basics (mission, key projects, how to contribute)
- **Optimal:** 400-800 words with sections for different visitor needs
- **Maximum:** Avoid walls of text exceeding 2,000 words; consider linking to separate documentation

Prioritize scannability over comprehensiveness.
